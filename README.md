# DuckDuckGo Image Scraper

This python module is just meant to make downloading images from duck duck go much easier.
You can use the search function to generate a list of URL's from the search query.
This query is parsed so treat the search as you would do it in duckduckgo.

Currently only works if you have Chrome or Brave browser installed

It also includes a function to save images from url's which while adapted for DDG is general to any url
and an all in one search_and_save() function which will search DDG, get all 100 images and save to folder.
